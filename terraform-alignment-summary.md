# Terraform Infrastructure Alignment Summary

## ‚úÖ Successfully Completed

### 1. Imported Existing Resources into Terraform State
- Resource Group: `bluewave-rg`
- Storage Account: `bluewaveplatformsa`
- Event Hub Namespace: `bw-dev-uks-eventhubs-001`
- Event Hubs: `claims-realtime`, `audit-events`
- Key Vault: `bwdevukskv001` (recreated as `bw-dev-kv-cknp0a`)
- Databricks Workspace: `bw-dev-uks-databricks-001`
- Log Analytics Workspace: `bw-dev-uks-logs-001`
- Application Insights: `bw-dev-uks-appinsights-001`
- Virtual Network: `bw-dev-uks-vnet-001`

### 2. Updated Terraform Configuration to Match Azure
- Storage replication: Changed from LRS to GRS
- Event Hub audit partitions: Changed from 4 to 8
- Log retention: Changed from 30 to 730 days
- Added zone redundancy for Event Hubs
- Fixed resource naming to match deployed resources

### 3. Partially Applied Infrastructure Updates
Successfully created/updated:
- New Key Vault with proper RBAC configuration
- User Assigned Managed Identity
- Network Security Groups for subnets
- Budget alerts and monitoring action groups
- Resource tags standardization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues to Resolve

### 1. Existing Resources Need Import
Several resources already exist in Azure but aren't in Terraform state:
- Private DNS zones (blob, dfs, keyvault, eventhub)
- Subnets (databricks-public, databricks-private, private-endpoints)
- Private endpoints for various services

### 2. Configuration Conflicts
- Storage account versioning cannot be enabled with HNS (Data Lake Gen2)
- Subnet address ranges overlap with existing subnets
- Diagnostic settings conflict with existing settings

### 3. Additional Azure Resources Not in Terraform
These exist in Azure but aren't defined in our Terraform:
- Azure Cognitive Services
- Azure Container Registry
- Azure Service Bus
- Databricks Access Connector

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Import remaining resources**:
```bash
# Import private DNS zones
terraform import azurerm_private_dns_zone.storage_blob /subscriptions/d08a685d-04bd-4a4f-befa-b8cab29d4c71/resourceGroups/bluewave-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/privatelink.blob.core.windows.net

# Import subnets
terraform import azurerm_subnet.databricks_public /subscriptions/d08a685d-04bd-4a4f-befa-b8cab29d4c71/resourceGroups/bluewave-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/bw-dev-uks-vnet-001/subnets/databricks-public
```

2. **Fix subnet configuration** - Update subnet CIDR ranges to avoid conflicts

3. **Add missing services to Terraform** (optional):
- Create modules for Cognitive Services, Container Registry, Service Bus

4. **Clean up diagnostic settings** - Remove conflicting diagnostic settings from Azure portal

## Current State
- **Terraform manages**: Core infrastructure resources
- **Partially managed**: Networking and security components
- **Azure-only**: Additional services (Cognitive Services, ACR, Service Bus)

The infrastructure is functional but requires additional imports and configuration adjustments for complete Terraform management.
